# Sprout

## Introduction

Sprout provides a Docker-powered local development experience for Roots that is compatible with macOS, Windows (WSL2), and Linux. Other than Docker, no software or libraries are required to be installed on your local computer before using. Sprout's simple CLI means you can start building your Roots sites without any previous Docker experience.
